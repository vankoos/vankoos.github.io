The following is a comparison of two search engines: lunr: simple, no need to synchronize index.json, no limit for contentLength, but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library) algolia: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize index.json and limit for contentLength The content of the post is separated by h2 and h3 HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search. contentLength is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with h2 and h3 HTML tag. Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice. To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, you need to upload different index.json for each language to the different index of algolia, such as zh-cn/index.json or fr/index.json… ","date":"2020-03-06","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-basics/:5:2","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":null,"content":"  LoveIt is a clean, elegant but advanced blog theme for Hugo developed by Dillon.
